 The matrix elements are in units of recoil energy $E_{\mathrm{rec}} = \frac{\hbar ^2 k^2}{2 m}$, where $m$ is the mass of the atoms of the BEC, and $k$ is the photon wave number of the light forming the optical lattice.
Experimentally the Bose-Hubbard model is often realized using ultracold gases of Rb-87 and lattice wavelengths of $\lambda = 1064 \: \mathrm{nm}$. Thus, the recoil energy is on the order of ... (units of ??)

In quantum optimal control a given state transfer or unitary is achieved by dynamically manipulating a system through a time-dependent Hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
	\hat{H} =  \hat{H}_0 + \sum_{n = 1}^{m}  \hat{H}_n (u_n(t)) \; ,
	\label{eq:ControlHamiltonians}
\end{equation} 
where $\hat{H}_0$ is an uncontrollable drift, while $\hat{H}_n$ can be adjusted through the control functions $u_n(t)$. Here, . The system is well described by the Bose-Hubbard model.

 Alternatively, the interaction $U$ can be expressed in units of the tunneling $J$, whereby the interaction term of the Bose-Hubbard model constitutes the control Hamiltonian, while the tunneling can be modeled as the drift.
